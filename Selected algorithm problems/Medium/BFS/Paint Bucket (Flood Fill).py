BinarySearch problem
You are given a two dimensional array matrix, containing strings "r", "g", and "b". Perform a floodfill operation at row r, column c with the color target.

A floodfill operation replaces elements that are connected to matrix[r][c] (up/right/down/left) and have the same color as matrix[r][c] with the color of target.

Constraints

n, m â‰¤ 200 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
Example 1
Input
matrix = [
    ["r", "r", "r"],
    ["r", "g", "b"],
    ["g", "b", "b"]
]
r = 0
c = 0
target = "g"
Output
[
    ["g", "g", "g"],
    ["g", "g", "b"],
    ["g", "b", "b"]
]
Explanation
The red elements connected to matrix[0][0] are replaced with "g".
